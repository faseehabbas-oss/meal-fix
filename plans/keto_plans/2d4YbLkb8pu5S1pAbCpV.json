Process your zucchini hummus for about 30 seconds - 1\nminute, until you get desired consistency. Season to taste\nby adding more salt, if needed.\n3. Prep your collard wraps by placing them flat (rough side\nup) on a cutting board and gently glide a sharp paring knife\nacross the length of the stem, shaving it down to the same\nthickness as the rest of the leaf. Each wrap will require two\nleaves for rolling.\n4. Place two leaves head to foot, overlapping halfway. Apply\na good amount of hummus at the center where the two\nleaves overlap. Add desired toppings (see notes). Fold in\nsides and tightly roll like you would a burrito. Cut through\nthe centre just before eating. Enjoy!",
