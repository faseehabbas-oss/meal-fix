As it's cooking you may need to\nadd more water if the mixture is looking too dry and the\nlentils aren't submerged (I didn't find that necessary).\nBring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat\nslightly to low (or medium-low), add corn (optional), cover,\nand gently simmer for 20 minutes to meld the flavors\ntogether. Stir occasionally.\nTaste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more chili\npowder or cumin for smokiness, salt for saltiness, or a little\ncoconut sugar to balance the heat and draw out the other\nflavours.\nServe as is, or garnished with tortilla chips, and/or avocado\n(optional).\nStore leftovers in the refrigerator up to 4 days, and in the\nfreezer up to 1 month.

Stir occasionally.\nTaste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more chili\npowder or cumin for smokiness, salt for saltiness, or a little\ncoconut sugar to balance the heat and draw out the other\nflavours.\nServe as is, or garnished with tortilla chips, and/or avocado\n(optional).\nStore leftovers in the refrigerator up to 4 days, and in the\nfreezer up to 1 month.
