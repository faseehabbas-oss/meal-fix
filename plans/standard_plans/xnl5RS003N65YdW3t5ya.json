Add walnuts or cashews, baking soda, and salt. Pulse\n10-12 times, for 1 second each, until the nuts and oats are\nchopped but not fine.\n4. Add the applesauce, maple syrup, and cinnamon. Process\nuntil a dough forms. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.\n5. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the dates to the food\nprocessor, reserving the soaking liquid; there\ufffds no need to\nwash the processor bowl.\n6. Add a tablespoon of the soaking liquid, the banana,\nlemon zest, lemon juice and the nutmeg. Pulse several\ntimes to combine, then process until smooth. The paste\nshould be thick but still liquid. Add a little more soaking\nliquid as needed.\n7. While the food processor is running, use wet hands to\npress two-thirds of the dough firmly into the bottom of the\nprepared pan. Once the banana date paste is smooth,\nspread it evenly across the dough. Break the remaining\ndough into marble-size pieces, sprinkle them across the\nbanana paste, and lightly press in.\n8. Bake for 16-18 minutes, until the oat topping is golden\nbrown. Let cool on a wire rack. Cover and store in the\nrefrigerator. Enjoy",

Or, cover the dates with water and\nmicrowave for 45 seconds.\n3. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade,\nprocess oats for several minutes until you have a coarse oat\nflour. Add walnuts or cashews, baking soda, and salt. Pulse\n10-12 times, for 1 second each, until the nuts and oats are\nchopped but not fine.\n4. Add the applesauce, maple syrup, and cinnamon. Process\nuntil a dough forms. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.\n5. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the dates to the food\nprocessor, reserving the soaking liquid; there\ufffds no need to\nwash the processor bowl.\n6. Add a tablespoon of the soaking liquid, the banana,\nlemon zest, lemon juice and the nutmeg. Pulse several\ntimes to combine, then process until smooth. The paste\nshould be thick but still liquid. Add a little more soaking\nliquid as needed.\n7. While the food processor is running, use wet hands to\npress two-thirds of the dough firmly into the bottom of the\nprepared pan. Once the banana date paste is smooth,\nspread it evenly across the dough. Break the remaining\ndough into marble-size pieces, sprinkle them across the\nbanana paste, and lightly press in.\n8. Bake for 16-18 minutes, until the oat topping is golden\nbrown. Let cool on a wire rack. Cover and store in the\nrefrigerator. Enjoy",

Then add dates and remaining cinnamon and pulse until a loose dough is formed. Transfer mixture to a mixing bowl.\n5. Slowly add apples to the date mixture a few Tbsp at a time until the mixture forms a moist dough. If your mixture gets too wet, simply add more ground walnuts, almonds, or even a handful oats. Reserve any leftover apples for other use (oatmeal, smoothies, yogurt, etc.)\n6. Transfer apple, nut, and date mixture to loaf pan. Spread evenly with a spoon or spatula. Top with plastic wrap and use fingers to press it firmly into all corners until uniformly flat on top. Cover and freeze to set.\n7. Remove from freezer. Chop into desired number of bars - anywhere from 4-8\n\nNotes:\nFor extra thick bars, squeeze the mixture into 3/4 of the pan and reserve a blank space.

Bake in the preheated oven until the tofu is lightly browned and just starting to crisp, about 40 minutes, taking the baking sheet out and flipping the pieces halfway through. 5. Meanwhile, thoroughly dry the chickpeas on a plate lined with paper towels. In a small mixing bowl, combine chickpeas, the remaining \ufffd tablespoon olive oil, the curry powder, a pinch of salt, and some pepper. Toss to coat, then spread the chickpeas out on the other baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the chickpeas are golden brown and crispy, 30 to 35 minutes. 6. When the tofu and chickpeas are roasted, let them cool for 5 minutes while you make the vinaigrette: Whisk together the blood orange juice, vinegar, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl. Add the olive oil and continue to whisk until everything is combined. 7. Assemble the salad: Toss the spinach with half of the vinaigrette in a serving bowl, until all the leaves are evenly coated. Top with half the tofu and half the chickpeas.",

Slowly add apples to the date mixture a few Tbsp at a time until the mixture forms a moist dough. If your mixture gets too wet, simply add more ground walnuts, almonds, or even a handful oats. Reserve any leftover apples for other use (oatmeal, smoothies, yogurt, etc.)\n6. Transfer apple, nut, and date mixture to loaf pan. Spread evenly with a spoon or spatula.

Bake for 15-20 minutes or until soft and fragrant. Set aside.\n4. In a food processor, add the almonds and walnuts. Grind into a meal - a few chunkier pieces are OK. Then add dates and remaining cinnamon and pulse until a loose dough is formed. Transfer mixture to a mixing bowl.\n5. Slowly add apples to the date mixture a few Tbsp at a time until the mixture forms a moist dough. If your mixture gets too wet, simply add more ground walnuts, almonds, or even a handful oats. Reserve any leftover apples for other use (oatmeal, smoothies, yogurt, etc.)\n6. Transfer apple, nut, and date mixture to loaf pan. Spread evenly with a spoon or spatula. Top with plastic wrap and use fingers to press it firmly into all corners until uniformly flat on top. Cover and freeze to set.\n7. Remove from freezer. Chop into desired number of bars - anywhere from 4-8\n\nNotes:\nFor extra thick bars, squeeze the mixture into 3/4 of the pan and reserve a blank space. This will make less bars, but they will be much thicker",

Transfer the quinoa to a large plate and scatter the edamame on top; drizzle with the oil. Spread in an even layer with a wooden spoon, drawing lines in it to cool it quickly.\n4. Transfer the cooled quinoa to a large bowl and add the grated carrots. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm or chill at least 2 hours, or until ready to serve. Optional: you can add leafy greens, bell peppers, nuts, seeds or any other vegetables you have at hand.",

Then add dates and remaining cinnamon and pulse until a loose dough is formed. Transfer mixture to a mixing bowl.\n5. Slowly add apples to the date mixture a few Tbsp at a time until the mixture forms a moist dough. If your mixture gets too wet, simply add more ground walnuts, almonds, or even a handful oats. Reserve any leftover apples for other use (oatmeal, smoothies, yogurt, etc.)\n6. Transfer apple, nut, and date mixture to loaf pan. Spread evenly with a spoon or spatula. Top with plastic wrap and use fingers to press it firmly into all corners until uniformly flat on top. Cover and freeze to set.\n7. Remove from freezer. Chop into desired number of bars - anywhere from 4-8\n\nNotes:\nFor extra thick bars, squeeze the mixture into 3/4 of the pan and reserve a blank space. This will make less bars, but they will be much thicker",

Cut the tofu into \ufffd-inch thick rectangles, then cut each rectangle diagonally into 2 triangles. Dry the tofu triangles by pressing them between two paper towels. 3. Drizzle \ufffd tablespoon of the olive oil over one of the baking sheets, then gently lay the tofu triangles on the baking sheet. Season the tofu with a pinch of salt and some pepper, then flip the tofu and season again, so that the tofu gets lightly coated with olive oil, salt, and pepper on both sides. 4. Bake in the preheated oven until the tofu is lightly browned and just starting to crisp, about 40 minutes, taking the baking sheet out and flipping the pieces halfway through. 5. Meanwhile, thoroughly dry the chickpeas on a plate lined with paper towels. In a small mixing bowl, combine chickpeas, the remaining \ufffd tablespoon olive oil, the curry powder, a pinch of salt, and some pepper. Toss to coat, then spread the chickpeas out on the other baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the chickpeas are golden brown and crispy, 30 to 35 minutes. 6. When the tofu and chickpeas are roasted, let them cool for 5 minutes while you make the vinaigrette: Whisk together the blood orange juice, vinegar, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl. Add the olive oil and continue to whisk until everything is combined. 7. Assemble the salad: Toss the spinach with half of the vinaigrette in a serving bowl, until all the leaves are evenly coated. Top with half the tofu and half the chickpeas.",

Then add dates and remaining cinnamon and pulse until a loose dough is formed. Transfer mixture to a mixing bowl.\n5. Slowly add apples to the date mixture a few Tbsp at a time until the mixture forms a moist dough. If your mixture gets too wet, simply add more ground walnuts, almonds, or even a handful oats. Reserve any leftover apples for other use (oatmeal, smoothies, yogurt, etc.)\n6. Transfer apple, nut, and date mixture to loaf pan. Spread evenly with a spoon or spatula. Top with plastic wrap and use fingers to press it firmly into all corners until uniformly flat on top. Cover and freeze to set.\n7. Remove from freezer. Chop into desired number of bars - anywhere from 4-8\n\nNotes:\nFor extra thick bars, squeeze the mixture into 3/4 of the pan and reserve a blank space. This will make less bars, but they will be much thicker",
