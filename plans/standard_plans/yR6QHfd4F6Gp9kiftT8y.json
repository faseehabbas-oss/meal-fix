When the potatoes have 10 minutes left to cook, rinse\nthe kale under cold water to remove any dirt. Using a sharp\nparing knife, cut out the rib of each kale leaf. Slice the\nleaves roughly 1/2\" thick. Heat remaining ghee in a large\nsaut\ufffd pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the kale.\nCook, turning the leaves over occasionally until they have\nwilted and are tender. Season with salt and pepper. Remove\nto a bowl and cover to stay warm.\n4. Rinse the pan that you just cooked the kale in and add 2\ufffd\nof water. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Crack\nan egg into a ramekin or tea cup and gently slide it into the\nwater. Repeat with remaining eggs. Cover with a lid and\nturn off the heat. Turn on your timer for 3 minutes for a\nrunnier yolk, and 4 minutes for a firmer yolk.\n5. While the eggs are cooking, place kale in four bowls and\ntop with potato hash.\n6. Once the eggs are cooked, remove from water with a\nslotted spoon and place egg on top of the kale and potato,\nfollowed by avocado and salsa. Season to taste with salt\nand pepper. Serve immediately.",

Immediately add the cereal mixture to the oats mixture, mixing with a spatula until coated. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan and flatten with the back of a measuring cup. Place a large piece of parchment paper or wax paper atop the bar mixture and use it to spread, flatten, and very firmly compact the bars evenly in the pan. Cool completely.

Spread the oats and pecans on a large rimmed baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 6 to 8 minutes, shaking halfway through, until golden and fragrant. Transfer to a large bowl; add the chopped cranberries. Bring the milk to a boil in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Stir in the multi-grain cereal and remove from the heat; let stand for 2 minutes. Add the nut or seed butter, maple syrup, cinnamon, and salt. Cook and stir the mixture over low heat for 6 to 7 minutes or until thickened; remove from the heat and stir in vanilla extract. Immediately add the cereal mixture to the oats mixture, mixing with a spatula until coated. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan and flatten with the back of a measuring cup. Place a large piece of parchment paper or wax paper atop the bar mixture and use it to spread, flatten, and very firmly compact the bars evenly in the pan. Cool completely. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or until firm. Using the liner, lift the mixture from the pan and transfer to a cutting board. Peel off the foil or parchment and cut into 16 bars",

Transfer to a large bowl; add the chopped cranberries. Bring the milk to a boil in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Stir in the multi-grain cereal and remove from the heat; let stand for 2 minutes. Add the nut or seed butter, maple syrup, cinnamon, and salt. Cook and stir the mixture over low heat for 6 to 7 minutes or until thickened; remove from the heat and stir in vanilla extract. Immediately add the cereal mixture to the oats mixture, mixing with a spatula until coated. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan and flatten with the back of a measuring cup. Place a large piece of parchment paper or wax paper atop the bar mixture and use it to spread, flatten, and very firmly compact the bars evenly in the pan. Cool completely. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or until firm. Using the liner, lift the mixture from the pan and transfer to a cutting board. Peel off the foil or parchment and cut into 16 bars",

In a small bowl whisk together flour, nutritional yeast, garlic and other spices, baking soda,and water. Heat additional tsp or so of oil in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. You want to make sure the pan has enough oil to prevent the omelette from sticking. Pour batter into hot skillet. Shimmy the pan a little to spread around pan in a thin layer. Cook for 4-5 minutes until edges have set and bubbles have formed across the surface. Gently shake the pan to loosen and carefully flip. Continue to cook for 2-3 more minutes adding desired toppings. If using a vegan cheese such as Daiya, cover pan with a lid to help melt the cheese. Check that omelette has thoroughly cooked by lifting away from pan slightly. It should be be dry and lightly browned. It is important to cook well because raw/undercooked garbanzo flour does not taste best. Flip one side over to close and serve immediately",
